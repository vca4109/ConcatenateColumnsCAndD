ðŸ”— ConcatenateColumnsCAndD_AB â€” Merge Column Values into a Single Cell
This VBA macro concatenates values from columns C and D in the "BL-BID" sheet starting from row 3, and inserts the combined result into a merged cell in column F (rows 3 to 30).

ðŸ”¹ What it does:
Loops through all rows (starting from row 3) until the last non-empty cell in either column C or D.
For each row, if both column C and D contain data, it creates a string in the format:

ValueC1(ValueD1), ValueC2(ValueD2), ...
After building the string, it:

Removes the trailing comma and space.
Inserts the result into a merged block of cells from F3:F30.
Aligns the text to top-left for readability.

ðŸ§¾ Example Output:
If your data looks like this:


C	D
Cable A	100m
Conduit B	200m
The merged cell in F3:F30 will display:


Cable A(100m), Conduit B(200m)
âœ… Highlights:
Dynamically calculates the maximum of used rows in both C and D, ensuring complete coverage.

Clean output format, removing trailing punctuation.

Supports customization by adjusting the range or sheet name.

Ready to use in summary sections or documentation fields.

ðŸ’¡ Example Usage:

Sub ConcatenateColumnsCAndD_AB()
    ' Run this to merge values from C & D into one formatted string in F3:F30
End Sub
Tip: If you want to include a fixed prefix or title before the string (e.g., "Material List: "), just assign a value to the fixedText variable before it's combined.
